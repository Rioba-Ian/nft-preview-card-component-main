## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned
I learnt to use semantic html tags; section; article and use divs where divs should be used. I also learnt to add hover state to image while
also changing their opacity. In comparison to some challenges or projects that I had done before; I learnt a couple of new things in this one.
